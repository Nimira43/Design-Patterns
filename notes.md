## TypeScript Design Patterns

#### TypeScript design patterns are essentially reusable solutions to common software design problems. They help developers create more flexible, maintainable, and scalable code. Here's a quick rundown:

#### Types of Design Patterns

###### Creational Patterns: 
These deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.

###### Singleton: 
Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.

###### Factory Method: 
Defines an interface for creating an object, but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.

##### Builder: 
Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

###### Prototype: 
Creates new objects by copying an existing object, known as the prototype.

###### Structural Patterns: 
These concern the composition of classes or objects to form larger structures.

###### Adapter: 
Allows incompatible interfaces to work together by wrapping an existing class with a new interface.

###### Composite: 
Composes objects into tree structures to represent part-whole hierarchies.

###### Decorator: 
Attaches additional responsibilities to an object dynamically.

###### Facade: 
Provides a simplified interface to a complex subsystem.

###### Behavioural Patterns: 
These are concerned with communication between objects.

###### Observer: 
Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.

###### Strategy: 
Enables selecting an algorithm's behaviour at runtime by defining a family of algorithms, encapsulating each one, and making them interchangeable.

###### Command: 
Turns a request into a stand-alone object containing all information about the request, thus allowing for parameterisation and queuing of requests.

###### Chain of Responsibility: 
Passes a request along a chain of handlers until one of the handlers processes the request.

#### Why Use Design Patterns?

###### Reusability: 
Design patterns provide tested, proven development paradigms.

###### Flexibility: 
They make it easier to change or extend code without breaking existing functionality.

###### Maintainability: 
They improve the readability and maintainability of the codebase.
